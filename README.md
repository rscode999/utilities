# Utility Classes and Programs
Contains useful command-line tools

Contains 3 sub-directories:
- `fast_linked_list`- a linked list designed to iterate through all its elements in linear time using only the "get" method
- `segmented_array`- an array that divides its content into segments of a set size
- `standalone_programs`- miscellaneous programs for varying purposes. All C programs require the `cs50.h` header, a leftover from AP Computer Science, for command-line inputs.
